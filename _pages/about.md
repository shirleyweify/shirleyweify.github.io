I am currently a 1-year PhD student in Innovation and Information Management at HKU.
My research subarea is business analytics / statistics / data science.
Click [here](https://hkubs-stat.github.io/) to see our website page.

Before joining the HKU, I worked as a research assistant at the [FinStar](https://finstar.ust.hk/) Lab of HKUST for one year.
I obtained my MSc(BA) degree at HKUST and BSc in mathematics and applied mathematics at Wuhan U.

If you are interested to collaborate, please do not hesitate to reach me by my email fwei@connect.hku.hk.
