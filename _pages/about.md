I am a PhD student in [The Statistics Group](https://hkubs-stat.github.io/) at HKU Business School.
Before joining the HKU, I worked as a research assistant at the [FinStar Lab](https://finstar.ust.hk/) in HKUST for one year.

My research interests include deep learning in biostatistics, particularly in neuroscience, financial econometrics, high dimensional statistics and time series analysis.
