I am a PhD student in [the Statistics Group](https://hkubs-stat.github.io/) at HKU Business School.
Before joining the HKU, I worked as a research assistant at [FinStar@HKUST](https://finstar.ust.hk/) for one year.

My research interest lies in statistical learning and data science, their applications in biostatistics, finance and other business-related senarios.
