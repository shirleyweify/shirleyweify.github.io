I am currently a 1-year PhD student in Innovation and Information Management at HKU.
My research subarea is business analytics / statistics / data science.

Before joining the HKU, I worked as a research assistant at the FinStar Lab, HKUST for one year.
I obtained my MSC(BA) degree at HKUST and BSc in mathematics and applied mathematics at Wuhan U.
